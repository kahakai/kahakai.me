SeriesTracker (https://github.com/kahakai/SeriesTracker) is a simple iOS app that allows a user to track desired TV series or anything else that has more than one episode/part in a simple way and locally to have better control. I made this app for myself first of all to use instead of plain text in a note that I had before.
