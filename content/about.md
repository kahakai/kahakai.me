I’m Artyom, or Arty, and I'm a geek, a digital nomad, a surfer, a software engineer, a community organizer, a public speaker, and the list can go on.

I'm a Software Engineer with 6.5+ years of experience, mostly in mobile native app development, who is working hard to transition to backend development with Go and Elixir.

I use Neovim btw.

I have about 2 years of non-professional Go experience and about 1 year of non-professional Elixir experience, and I’m open to considering any opportunity that will allow me to gain professional experience in this direction and deepen the knowledge. Suggestions of a part-time job or (paid) internships are also welcome!

I will be happy to discuss any details and tell you more about myself.
