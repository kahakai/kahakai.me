What does kahakai mean? Why does the blog has such an unusual name?

kahakai is my nickname that I've come up with after realising I'm starting a new chapter of my life with the new values, principles, and focus. First, I used it on the Fediverse to see how it goes, and I think after several month I like it and feel like sticking to it.

This is a combination of words kaha and kai.

kaha has these meanings:
- A Māori term roughly translating as strength.
- "This way, thus, in this matter, like that, the way that it is" in Hebrew.
- A Sanskrit term meaning "to speak".

kai has these meanings:
- In Hawaiian culture, the word “kai” holds a special significance. It means “ocean” or “sea” and is often used in greetings and proverbs to symbolize the vastness and power of the ocean.
- Kai is most commonly a Hawaiian boy's name.
- "Kia kaha" is a Māori term of affirmation or support.

Now the meaning of kahakai should be clear. I like the senses that I put into it, and I hope you can feel that too.
