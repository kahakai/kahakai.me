The participation became an eye-opening and life-changing experience for me, and there a lot of things that struck me and stuck with me.\nOnce we had a session with our main lecturer and organizer, and I want to share one thing, the ending of one of his stories that almost made me cry, because I recognized myself and my life path in these words, and didn’t even think I needed to hear that from someone to feel that I make the right things and to feel supported:\nFor a small group of people who built a cart for a (race) competition and then crashed it in the first three seconds it was not a failure but a success because there is a thousand of people sitting on their sofas who said they would do better but they didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nSo when you think you do or make something useless think about the quote above and realize that you’re already doing more than the majority of people and in any way you got experience that will contribute to your future endeavors.\nWhat does it have to do with passion?\nTo me these things are related. I never thought about that, but before I heard the quote above I had a moment that allowed me to discover my superpower which is being a passionate person.\nNow that I had some time to think about it I realize that passion was my inner driver for more than last ten years of my life and maybe even the whole life when I didn’t know anything, including this word.\nI’ll probably write about this more later some day, but the main point is that passion means much more to me than money or anything in between, regardless of personal life or work, and it spreads across all the things I do like tasks, learning, hobbies, etc.\nI get inspired from other people like this every time I hear or see them and what they do or just read about them and understand that I’m touching or interacting with something that they made or were part of. I want to be like them, like other passionate people that were able to push the boundaries, doesn’t mean small or big, they don’t stop, because they want to do something to the world and they do those things instead of sitting on their sofas.\nI definitely will.\n","date":"16 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1710617127428-passion-is-superpower/","section":"Posts","summary":"Recently I participated in a social program made for unemployed people to help them develop the skills for their personal and professional path.","title":"Passion is superpower"},{"content":"","date":"16 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":"16 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"16 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/thought/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Thought"},{"content":"Seems like an easy question and an obvious one how to answer to but it is actually tough!\nI think it is even a bit a tactless question in our modern world.\nIt is more about what the other person wants to hear, not what you want to say.\nMany people, I believe it is the majority of people, don\u0026rsquo;t understand why others are struggling with answering because they have never experienced that, they don\u0026rsquo;t know what is it to move to a whole another country, how much does it cost both in terms of money and all the other stuff like effort, time, understanding, risk, lost, and emotions, positive and negative.\nPeople move a lot nowadays, our minds shifted to how we see \u0026ldquo;base\u0026rdquo; country, we are more free and able to choose a country we want to live in and the opportunity to work remotely greatly helps.\nSome of us want a better climate and weather (like summer all year round), others look for people and society, just like to travel and live here and there, want to know about cultures, want to learn a language around native speakers, etc., or all these desires combined.\nThere are also some bad and sad factors, of course, that contribute to people tending to move to another country, may it be economic situation, political situation of any kind, human persecution for any reason, cost of living, and others.\nSo you have to keep this in mind when you are asking where someone is from. It may be either positive or negative experience for a person, you don\u0026rsquo;t know them and their backstory.\nOne more important moment to keep in mind is that a person can get confused by the question because when you changed your base country twice, three times or even more you don\u0026rsquo;t know what to consider as \u0026ldquo;from\u0026rdquo;, like what am I supposed to and what should I say?\nYou can name your home country, country of origin, your birthplace but I\u0026rsquo;m of the opinion that it\u0026rsquo;s not the same. What to consider your homeland is a whole another story.\nI was born and raised in Minsk, Belarus. I lived there for 23 years of my life, not exactly because I travelled a lot to different countries and places, but still it is my \u0026ldquo;country of origin\u0026rdquo; and it was my homebase.\nI lived in some other countries here and there during that period but never for more than one month, so it is not something like immigration and being an expat.\nThe next stop was Israel. That was an immigration and my new homebase.\nI lived in Israel in different cities for about two and a half years.\nThe next stop became Portugal which is currently is. This is also an immigration but a little different one and my new homebase.\nThese were all my own decisions. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful and happy for them. I asked myself and my parents from the childhood about if it is possible to live somewhere else, how would that happen and how would that feel.\nSince then, I decided that I want to leave my country of origin and live somewhere else.\nNot because something bothered me, or was bad to me, or I didn\u0026rsquo;t like something (of course there\u0026rsquo;s always something but that\u0026rsquo;s not the case I\u0026rsquo;m writing about) but because I was and I am genuinely passionate about freedom to travel and live wherever I want to, when I want to and how I want to.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s so much to explore in the world! I want to learn and know more about the countries, the people, the cultures, and everything in between.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what will come next after Portugal if it will.\nSo how do I answer the question where am I from?\nAfter thinking about it for some time and living through these situations many times I understood that I tend to choose the answer depending on the situation and my inner feelings.\nI can choose any variant because I don\u0026rsquo;t care.\nSometimes I do care, then I name the appropriate country as I feel it suits.\nWhat is more important for me is not the past, not where are you from but where are you now.\nThis leads us to the fact that I prefer to answer with Portugal (Lisboa, Portugal currently) because this is the place and everything around it, including mental part of the history, where I do live now, what I consider my homebase, what I\u0026rsquo;m attached to and feel emotional connection with, the bond.\nIn the end, I think that you should think twice before asking someone a question about where they are from.\nI believe it is not important as long as the person behaves with dignity, you can communicate with them and share something in common.\nIf it is the case then why ask in the first place? You don\u0026rsquo;t need that information.\nAnother way I see is stating the question differently.\nThere is actually one I\u0026rsquo;m aware of: instead of asking where someone is from ask them where they are local.\n","date":"7 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1709809867831-where-are-you-from/","section":"Posts","summary":"Seems like an easy question and an obvious one how to answer to but it is actually tough!","title":"Where are you from?"},{"content":"","date":"27 February 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/resource/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Resource"},{"content":" Speaker # Android Academy Jetpack Compose 2023 Announcement (Android Academy Global, Feb 2023): video Leveraging The Native Side of React Native (Loóna Talks: React Native, May 2022): slides, video Android Academy Fundamentals #11 - Animations (Android Academy Global, Feb 2021): slides, video Android Academy Fundamentals #7 - Networking (Android Academy Global, Dec 2020): slides, video Android 11 #5: Easing In and Out with Jetpack Compose (Android 11 Updates, Sep 2020): slides, video Introduction to Kotlin (Java course in BSU, Nov 2019): slides Android Academy Minsk Fundamentals #8 - Networking (Android Academy Minsk, Oct 2019): slides, video Android Navigation component спешит на помощь (GDG Minsk Meetup, Oct 2019): slides, video Podcasts # Spring Break.

I was born in Belarus. Nowadays I use and speak several languages in daily life every day but for the purpose of the article it\u0026rsquo;s enough to know that I\u0026rsquo;m native in Belarusian and Russian and understand and read Ukrainian on advanced level.\nYes, Artyom is the correct spelling of the name in English.\nIn my mother language(s) it is spelled Арцём (in Belarusian) and Артём (in Russian).\nYou see that \u0026ldquo;ё\u0026rdquo; letter? This is where the fun begins.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at what\u0026rsquo;s written in Wikipedia.\nArtyom (also Artiom) is a male given name common in Russia and other Slavic-speaking countries. The name uses the \u0026ldquo; ё\u0026rdquo; letter, which can be transcribed to English as \u0026ldquo;e\u0026rdquo; but still has the \u0026ldquo;yo\u0026rdquo; sound. Pronunciation is [ɐrˈtʲɵm].\nAlmost nobody I met throughout my currently 26 years old life could pronounce it right either from the first try or at all if that person is not native in Slavic (most notable East Slavic) languages from my experience.\nThe people who were the most close to correct pronunciation on the first try were Portuguese people with European Portuguese language which really surprised me.\nThey are definitely not the only ones but I can\u0026rsquo;t remember anyone else.\nHere is the first thing. Yes, it can be transcribed as \u0026ldquo;e\u0026rdquo; but it\u0026rsquo;s completely wrong in the sense that everyone starts to call you Artem like [ˈɐrtəm], [ɐrˈtəm], [ɐrˈtem] or other similar variations.\nMany Russian speakers disregard the letter \u0026ldquo;ё\u0026rdquo; in written language and use the letter \u0026ldquo;e\u0026rdquo; instead, although the sound of this letter, the \u0026ldquo;yo\u0026rdquo; sound, exists completely intact.\nI doubted this situation but still I didn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to it when I was younger. Today I believe that we should always use \u0026ldquo;ё\u0026rdquo; when it\u0026rsquo;s placed in the word and not disregard it in the favour of \u0026ldquo;e\u0026rdquo;, but that\u0026rsquo;s a whole another story.\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t call Artyoms like Artems, unless they explicitly use the spelling Artem themselves or ask you to call them like this which means they\u0026rsquo;re okay with it (I\u0026rsquo;m personally not).\nThe Belarusian spelling is Арцём (Artsiom).\nNow we need to head to the article for the Belarusian variant of the name. To be exact and honest I believe it is wrong to distinguish the name based on spellings like this because it is still the same name, although it is good and nowadays important to understand where it comes from (loosely related to another article of mine about what country to name when somebody asks you where you\u0026rsquo;re from).\nArtsyom (Belarusian: Арцём), also transliterated as Artsiom, is a popular masculine name in Belarus.\nI have never ever in my life seen the spelling Artsyom anywhere. Please don\u0026rsquo;t use it.\nThe spelling Artsiom is much more common among the people of Belarus (not sure about Ukraine), we also have it written in our passports.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if there ever was another spelling for the name to be used in official documents and passports but that is what we live with now. I won\u0026rsquo;t go into the details of the standards for romanizing Belarusian language because it\u0026rsquo;s confusing and complex but according to some of them the only spelling that is used in Belarus for the name Artyom is Artsiom. I have it written in my passport and other documents and I hate it since then. Fortunately, I had the ability to change it to Artyom in newer documents for other countries not so long ago.\nThe thing is I would love to leave the Belarusian spelling in any of the forms to have that connection with the motherland and be able to show it to others which is another emotional and psychological part of our today\u0026rsquo;s history but to me it looks ugly, and sounds awful, and makes it even more complicated for non-Slavic languages speakers (first of all for English speakers for me).\nA common diminutive form of the name is Tyoma (Цёма in Belarusian, Тёма in Russian, Тьома in Ukrainian).\nNo doubts about that. I think there\u0026rsquo;re no more diminutive forms except for diminutive form of a diminutive form. A lot of people call me like that, earlier I would allow only parents and some close friends to call me like that but looks like other people like it and like using it, so it became kind of a habit.\nUsually we call children by the name Tyoma, not adults but I\u0026rsquo;m fine and do also like it, so almost don\u0026rsquo;t care if somebody uses it to me right after we met for the first time.\nHowever, there is also a problem with that \u0026ldquo;yo\u0026rdquo; sound as you can spot.\nWhat options do we have?\nWe can spell it Tyoma or Tioma, but there\u0026rsquo;re a few others: Tema, Theme, Tim.\nI saw Tema a lot in my childhood but now I don\u0026rsquo;t, and I want to say not to use it as it\u0026rsquo;s the same case as with Artem.\nTheme is a nickname I once came up with for myself and used it for quite along time, although not in real life. It\u0026rsquo;s not directly related but Theme also causes difficulties with pronunciation for non-native English speakers, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to become Teme, Tem, Tim, or something else. I no longer use it even as a nickname on the internet (for other reasons).\nTim could be a solution to all the problems with spelling and pronunciation above. I saw some Artyoms on the internet and a few in real life who use the name Tim when communicating in English.\nI tried to also use it. Sadly or happily, I\u0026rsquo;m not Tim because I\u0026rsquo;m not Timothy, not Timothée, not Timur, and not someone else. I can\u0026rsquo;t relate to it and I don\u0026rsquo;t feel the connection, and it only has t and m (two letters) from my full actual name. So I don\u0026rsquo;t use Tim anymore.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get to the article for the Ukrainian variant of the name.\nArtem (Ukrainian: Арте́м, romanized: Artém, pronounced [ɐrˈtɛm]) is a male given name of Greek origin. It is also used in Armenian with the variant of Ardem in Western Armenian. Artyom (Артём), the Russian version of the name, is often romanized as Artem although the letter \u0026ldquo;ё\u0026rdquo; gives a [-tʲɵm] ending sound.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll not talk about Armenian variant, but look what we\u0026rsquo;ve got here, both Artem and Artyom.\nArtyom is mentioned as the Russian version of the name, and that\u0026rsquo;s true, but it\u0026rsquo;s the Belarusian version at the same time that is often gets discarded for some reason.\nIf we look at Ukrainian then Artem is the only correct and proper spelling of the name, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t result in using the \u0026ldquo;yo\u0026rdquo; sound!\nNow that we know that Artem is the name on its own, I\u0026rsquo;m fine to say that both Artyom and Artem are correct spelling, but please pay attention and take into account that this depends on the person, his language, country of origin, and perception.\nAt last, we need to visit one more form of the name.\nArtemy (Russian: Артемий), sometimes romanized as Artemiy, Artemi, or Artemij, is a full unique form of the Russian short male Artyom.\nI also know and saw a few people who have this name and use the spelling Artemii.\nI want to stress here that Artyom (Арцём, Артём, Артем) and Artemy (Арцемій, Артемий, Артемій) are two distinct names. Artyom can be used as a short version of Artemy (Арцемій -\u0026gt; Арцём, Артемий -\u0026gt; Артём, Артемій -\u0026gt; Артем) in our languages but the statement stays still.\nThere are also Artemius and Artemas, but we\u0026rsquo;ll not talk about them.\nAnyways, all of these names have common ancestor.\nThe name means \u0026ldquo;dedicated to Artemis\u0026rdquo; (Greek Αρτέμιος: safe, healthy, strong, thriving, bright, shiny).\nThe name is derived from the Ancient Greek name Artemios (Greek: Αρτέμιος), the name of the saint Artemius.\nNow, what is the solution to proper pronunciation of \u0026ldquo;yo\u0026rdquo; sound in -tyom ([-tʲɵm] ending sound)?\nIt is up to you if you have the name Artyom like me, but after some hours of trying to come up with some short variant and even find something useful on the internet to choose a preferred name I found out Arty to be the most accurate and appealing to me.\nArty ([ˈarti]) has almost all of the letters of the full name Artyom, Arty starts on A and is written in the same way, and, most importantly, Arty sounds similar to Artyom.\nI looked up that there is Arty (stylized as ARTY) the musician, DJ, record producer, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard about him and haven\u0026rsquo;t known anything, but I did like his music after listening to some random tracks (I like house and trance genres for a long time).\nI put this paragraph here to state that I don\u0026rsquo;t have any relations to ARTY and have nothing to do with him.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t find anything else about Arty as a word (except treating it like related to arts, which I do like) or anyone else who uses this name (to not be confused with someone that I don\u0026rsquo;t wish to), so we\u0026rsquo;re done with this.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used the name Arty for presenting myself and talking to a group of more than ten people for longer than a week so far, and it went smooth and pleasant for both sides (first and foremost for myself).\nConclusion:\nThe proper way to spell the name Арцём/Артем/Артём is Artyom (Belarusian, Russian) and Artem (Ukrainian). The proper way to pronounce the name Арцём/Артем/Артём is [ɐrˈtʲɵm] (Belarusian, Russian) and [ɐrˈtɛm] (Ukrainian). I\u0026rsquo;m using the spelling Artyom exclusively but I\u0026rsquo;m good with Ukrainian-speaking people using Artem in spoken language to me but still prefer the spelling Artyom in written language. Preferred name for short form and easier pronunciation is Arty. Please don\u0026rsquo;t use Tim or anything like this (to me). I hope these extensive explanations based on experience and life made it clear and will help diminish the ambiguity.\n","date":"24 February 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1708763372683-it-is-all-about-the-personal-name/","section":"Posts","summary":"Disclaimer: My name is Artyom.","title":"It is all about the personal name"},{"content":"What does kahakai mean?
